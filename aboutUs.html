                            Orbitz energy drink was founded in 1948 by Hit Chaudhary in London, Ontario. Fast forward to the early 2000s, Orbitz had fallen on hard times and was slated to close when Chaudhary brothers Harsh and Vasishth saw an opportunity and purchased the struggling business in 2001.
                            
                            Having operated their own scoop shop, Dad’s energy drink, in their hometown of Tillsonburg, Ontario, the brothers had some business experience. As the new owners of Orbitz, the brothers doubled down on the Orbitz family’s original vision of creating a high-quality product inspired by its small-town roots and community.
                            
                            They had to hustle and improvise to make the business thrive.</p>

                            <p class="italic">In the early years, each Brother focused on a different area of the business; Harsh headed up production and accounting, Vasishth oversaw sales and the dairy bar operation, and Harsh obtained his truck driver’s license to deliver their products himself.
                            
                            Over time, the duo began to distribute their products to scoop shops and grocery stores throughout Southwestern Ontario. They further expanded by offering co-manufacturing services for other energy drink brands. Today, Orbitz can be found in grocery stores across Canada!
                            
                           Orbitz eventually outgrew the production facility in London and in 2019 the brotherss opened a state-of-the-art production facility in the small, rural town of Tillsonburg to continue building the Orbitz brand in addition to producing a variety of frozen indulgences for private label customers.
                            
                            Above all, Orbitz has maintained a legacy of creating the highest quality energy drink by using fresh and quality of products. Their own process brings you the classic taste that you remember from years past full of tradition and simply the great taste you deserve.</p>
